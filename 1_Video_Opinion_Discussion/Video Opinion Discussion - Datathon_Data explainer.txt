High-level use case explanation?
Vialog is a video opinion discussion tool that our customers can embed onto their website to enable a more personal way of communication.


What kind of data is in the package?
What file consists of what kind of data?
In the zip file we provide, you can find a total of 9 files, 3 for each discussion. The number in the file name identifies the files that belong to a discussion. There are 3 different files for each discussion.
- MOD_Discussion: Small number of events containing snapshots of the discussion properties
- MOD_Video: Video moderation events for all videos that belong to this discussion
- Usage: Events generated by the embedded Vialog tool. For simplicity only 2 types of events are included here


Connections between IDs (vocabulary, explaining individual)
A little help:
- DiscussionId === ThreadId
- Video_Token values from the MOD_Video events can be found in the Usage events' payloads to identify which video was played
- These events were not introduced at the same time, so there might be slight inconsistencies
